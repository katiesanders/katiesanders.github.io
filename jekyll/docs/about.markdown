I am a college Sophomore studying Computer Science, Music and Electrical Engineering the University of Illinois at Urbana-Chapmaign. I've been a piano student since age 4, and am currently picking up guitar. I enjoy composing different genres of music electronically using Ableton Live, Sibelius, and Logic Pro. I've been swimming competitively since age 5. As a freshman, I swam for the UIUC women's varsity team and am now a member of the Illini Swim Club. My goal in college is to combine my love of computers, music and electronics to pursue a career in software development, game design, or music production!
